# microG wiki

This is a *soft-*fork from the [microG/GmsCore GitHub wiki](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/wiki).

The wiki could use some improvements, this is what this is for.
The wiki was previously open, but too open, meaning users could contribute but also vandalization happened. With a standard repo, it is possible to approve things with PRs and issues, as well as creating a separate environment from the code.

This wiki is being to be user-centric, not developer-centric at the moment.

## Contributing and data

This wiki is meant to target the newest version of microG, always. This includes the "previews", but does not include nightly builds. (e.g. anything that's in commits but not launched as a release)
It also targets the newest Android versions, even when microG doesn't, for simplicity. Notes about older versions are welcome, though.

### About branches

* `master` is the main branch.
* `archive` keeps the branch as it was when first pulled.
* `upstream` is meant to keep a state of the current Git history of the upstream wiki is at the current moment.

Other branches are temporary, for internal development, or are missing from documentation.

### Outdated pages

Some pages need extra work to update, but have useful information which may not want to be lost, but might also cause confusion and problems in the present. These are kept in [`/wiki/.outdated`](/wiki/.outdated). You can link to these in other pages if necessary.

Ideally, these pages are to be updated, if you'd like to do it, you're welcome to do and I thank you!

### Issues and PRs

If you notice any information needing updating, you can open an issue to highlight it or send a PR!

If you wanna contribute but don't know how, look in the issues section.
