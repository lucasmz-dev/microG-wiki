- Your System needs to support signature spoofing, see [Signature Spoofing](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing)
- In case you had the Google Play Services previously installed, remove all updates and the packages in `/system/priv-app` of the Google Services `GmsCore`, `GoogleBackupTransport`, `GoogleFeedback`, `GoogleLoginService`, `GoogleOneTimeInitializer`, `GooglePartnerSetup`, `GoogleServicesFramework`, `Phonesky`, `SetupWizard` and `Velvet`. In case you forgot to remove the `GmsCore` updates, you can manually remove these using `adb uninstall com.google.android.gms`. After that, reboot your android device - all privileged GAPPS should be removed.
