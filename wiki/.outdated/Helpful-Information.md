# Common Issues

This contains common, known issues with common solutions.

## Maps and YouTube / other Google apps not opening
microG doesn't seem to deal well with accounts being logged off. To solve this, go into Settings > Accounts and remove your Google account(s?). Then try logging back in.

## No notification from Google for 2 step verification
microG does not support notifications for 2 step verification, so you just won't receive them. You need to set up an alternative method like TOTP or a hardware key.
