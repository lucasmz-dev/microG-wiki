## Prerequisites

Make sure you configured a full-working build setup and have Android SDK and Java installed properly. 
Please note that building with other operating systems than Linux is not officially supported.

## Build stand-alone App with Gradle

Get the source code and clone it into your directory of choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore.git
cd android_packages_apps_GmsCore/
```

The cloned repository contains all required build scripts for gradle and the wrapper, which is needed to start the build process. Make sure you have your `ANDROID_SDK_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` properly defined in your `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`. 
It currently works with Java 17, newer versions might cause exceptions.

To build _GmsCore_, execute in your cloned directory
```bash
touch local.properties
./gradlew build
```
Gradle will tell you about which Android SDK packages are missing. UnifiedNLP will require one more dependency (see https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/blob/master/unifiednlp-compat/build.gradle). Install them using `$ANDROID_SDK_PATH/tools/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-27" "platforms;android-28" "build-tools;29.0.2"`. 

If you run out of memory while building, raise the limit by adding for example `org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError` to `gradle.properties`

The generated apks can be found in the subdirectory `play-services-core/build/outputs/apk/`.

You may want to sign your apk using the following commands in the `apk` directory with your specific configuration:
```bash
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore ~/path_to_your/keystore.jks play-services-core-release-unsigned.apk your_keystore_username --signedjar play-services-core-release-signed.apk
$ANDROID_SDK_HOME/build-tools/23.0.2/zipalign -p -v 4 play-services-core-release-signed.apk com.google.android.gms.apk
```
Alternatively, you can use this small bash script, which automates all required steps from above:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

mkdir microg
cd microg
mkdir outputs
mkdir keystores

ANDROID_SDK_PATH="/opt/android-sdk-update-manager"
KEYSTORES_PATH="$PWD/keystores"

# Generate keystore
echo "We need to create a keystore for GmsCore:"
keytool -genkey -v -keystore $KEYSTORES_PATH/playservices.jks -alias playservices -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000


# GMSCore
git clone https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore.git
cd android_packages_apps_GmsCore
echo "sdk.dir=$ANDROID_SDK_PATH" > local.properties
echo "sdk-location=$ANDROID_SDK_PATH" >> local.properties
# Add some memory to avoid build problems
echo "org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError" >> gradle.properties
./gradlew build
cp play-services-core/build/outputs/apk/release/play-services-core-release-unsigned.apk ../outputs/play-services-core-release.apk


# Sign APK
cd ../outputs
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore $KEYSTORES_PATH/playservices.jks play-services-core-release.apk playservices
$ANDROID_SDK_PATH/build-tools/22.0.1/zipalign -p -v 4 play-services-core-release.apk com.google.android.gms.apk
```

Congratulations, you got your `com.google.android.gms.apk`! Now head over to [Installation](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Installation).

### Gradle integrated signing
You can also sign and zipalign directly as part of the `./gradlew build` call. To do so, create a file `play-services-core/user.gradle` with the following content:
```groovy
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('~/path_to_your/keystore.jks')
            storePassword 'keystore password'
            keyAlias 'key alias'
            keyPassword 'key password'
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        /* Optional: sign debug builds with release key
        debug {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
        //*/
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```
When doing so, `./gradlew build` will produce the final file at `play-services-core/build/outputs/apk/play-services-core-release.apk`

## Integrate GmsCore in AOSP-based ROM

Direct build as part of AOSP is no longer supported. Please build a signed or unsigned APK using gradle and then use it as a prebuilt to AOSP build system.

Please note, that to make _GmsCore_ work, your ROM has to support [Signature Spoofing](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing).
